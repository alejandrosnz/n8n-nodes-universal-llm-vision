# Quick Guide: Using AI to Write Tests

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Create Tests

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST write tests for every operation you create. No exceptions.

**Process**:
1. Create operation file
2. **IMMEDIATELY** create test file (don't wait)
3. Write tests BEFORE moving to next operation
4. Run `npm test` to verify

**Why**: Agents sometimes skip tests. This prevents that.

To write unit tests it is suggested to use AI for help.

## Approach for Standard Unit Tests

1. **Create the test file**: Decide which node you want to test and create a test file with the corresponding name in the test folder. For example, for a node in `nodeA/v2/NodeAV2.node.ts`, create a test file in `nodeA/v2/test/NodeAV2.test.ts`.

2. **Use AI assistance**: Send this prompt to your AI tool (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.):
   ```
   Using guidelines in @UNIT_TESTING.md, write tests for @NodeAV2.node.ts in @NodeAV2.node.test.ts
   ```
   Make sure file names after `@` are detected and referenced by your tool.
   You can improve the prompt by asking to cover specific test cases.

3. **Review and refine**: Thoroughly review the generated tests, make necessary fixes, and remove redundant tests. __Even if generated by AI, it's still your responsibility to ensure tests are working and reasonable.__
